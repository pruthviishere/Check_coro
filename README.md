Covid-19 Classification Using Deep Learning in Chest X-Ray Images

We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in X-Rays images and differentiate it from nonâ€“COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases.
A deep learning neural network-based method , an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19.

we have proposed a deep learning neural network-based method , an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19 by analyzing the X-rays of patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography imaging of COVID-19 patients.
