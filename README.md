Covid-19 Classification Using Deep Learning in Chest X-Ray Images

I aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in X-Rays images and differentiate it from nonâ€“COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases.
A deep learning neural network-based method , an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19.
I have proposed a deep learning neural network-based method , an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19 by analyzing the X-rays of patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography imaging of COVID-19 patients.
Performed following tasks
Task 1: Importing, Cloning & Exploring Dataset
Task 2: Data visualization (Image Visualization)
Task 3: Data augmentation & Normalization
Task 4: Building Convolutional neural network model
Task 5: Compiling & Training CNN Model
Task 6: Performance evaluation & Testing the model & saving the model for future use
